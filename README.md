1.1	Problem Domain

Around 4.57 billion* Mobile Phones in the world frequently fail to provide users with satisfactory control over and visibility into
how third-party applications use their private data. These applications have easy access to huge amounts  of sensitive, personally
identifiable information and there are several applications which transmit this information over the network and use them for their
own endeavours and benefits. Ample amount of research has been done in past 7 to 8 years to gain control of fine-grained 
information being transmitted over the network and therefore, we aim to gain knowledge from recent findings and to move ahead 
in this area by enhancing and improving state-of-the-art algorithm for detecting PII leakage and calculating Energy Losses that 
users have to bear. 

1.2	Research Problem Statement    

Improvement of current state-of-the-art algorithm by introducing new heuristics and/or ensemble methods for identifying Personally 
Identifiable Information in data packets transmitted over the network. In addition to it, we aim to classify the transmission 
as: 
(a) intended to collect information about the user and necessary for the operation of application; 
(b) intended to collect information about the user but of curious nature; 
(c) not intended by the user.

Finally, we plan to calculate the consumption of energy associated with the transmission of unintended and intended data packets 
that will assist in creating awareness and giving further insight to users about their data.
